                <li>It helps the contributors to determine what exactly was altered/created in this commit.</li>
                <li>It helps visitors to understand how your project was made , what problems you faced and how you fixed them.</li>
                <li>It helps your teammates(if any) to pinpoint the updates/alterations in the project and decide their next step accordingly.</li>
                <li>And finally, it helps you! You can easily track all the changes you made , how and why  you made them.</li>
